# K-Code README

This is a vscode extension that makes use of vscode webview to open up a side bar that displays 3 different images according to the number of lines of code that contains errors in your current file. On default, 3 different emoji images will be shown, but this can be customized by uploading an image.

## Features

### Upload Image

After installation of the extension, you can upload an image using one of the buttons that can be seen in the side bar, namely `Update Happy Image`, `Update Moody Image` and `Update Frustrated Image`. Image formats of `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg` and `gif` are accepted. I personally recommend `gif`s as they are more fun! The respective images will then be rendered and show up according to the number of errors you have in your current file.

I understand that most of this feature technically allows you to add any image of your choice of any theme, but the ideas of this extension was to add a korean vibe and a little fun while coding. If you are a fellow kpop fan, I recommend that you find some funny kpop-related images and use it!

### Reset Images

If you want to reset the images to the default emojis, simply click the `Reset All Images` button,

### Play a random song

Click the `Play Random Song` button to play a random korean song on spotify. It will recommend you a song to boost your productivity!
